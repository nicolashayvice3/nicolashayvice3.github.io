        <h1 class="textcenter">Welcome to my amazingly average sprint 2 </h1>

    <h3>
        Margins, Borders and Padding
    </h3>
    <p> 
        All elements on an HTML page is essentially contained inside a rectangle or box. 
        These boxes/rectangles have the 3 properties: Margin, Border and Padding. These 3 properties 
        change all the visuals aspects of such element, insdie the box/rectangle.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Margin
    </h4>
    <p>
        With the box model there are 3 layers to every box. The Outer layer is the Margin, like the wrapping surrounding a paper.
        The Margin allows you to add spacing between the outside of the border and any of the other element with boxes/borders. The
        Margin can be changed on any side of the boxing individually, which gives it great potential to move all the elements around 
        page.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Border
    </h5>
    <p>
        The border is the box of the element. It is like the physical box containing the element, you can 
        change its thickness, positioning and even color. It is incredibly useful and can be changed in 
        many different ways to add great variety to your work.
    </p>
    <h6>
        Padding
    </h6>
    <p>
       An element's padding area is the space between its content and its border. The padding 
       can be controlled on any side such as the border. Its like filling the inside between a product 
       and its boxing, such as bublerap.

        Learning plan 
    </h6>
    <p class="coral">
        long term goal and/or career pathway
    </p>
    <p>
        I would like to code for quite a while in my life, I think its an interesting skill with huge
        amounts of room for development. But it is definitely not my goal in life, I have others and coding 
        is just one tool to be able for me to reach these goals. We could call coding a smaller objective in life
        that will suport me my bigger path to personal growth/achievement. I would like to fight for a living.
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        strengths and limitations in relation to learning
    </p>
    <p>
        I can be quite negative with myself and put myself down for not achieving what I believe 
        I should be. This is something I am workin on constantly and would definitely be a limitation.
        Also maybe my ability to comprehend certain subjects initially, specially when written. This is 
        something I have become acustomed to which is already a big step in overcoming it. On the other hand
        my strenghts would be the ability to learn new things, the interest and motivation I can bring to subjects
        I find to be interesting. Working with people, I would say im very fond of humans as they are mesmerasing 
        creatures. Forgot to add but public speaking would be a great thing to improve appon for me.
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        developing non-technical - human skills in EDA
    </p>
    <p>
        So as I said before I have developed the ability to view myself in kinder eyes when not accomplishing
        tasks straight away, or to perfection. I hope I develope even further my communication to speak in large 
        groups and working side by side with my cohort. Making it a habbit to ask even more questions (when applicable)
        would be nice.
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        Managing my workload in this programe
    </p>
    <p>
        For my workload I will like to plan weekly based on the phases we go through. Staying on track
        and coding every day should do the trick.
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        What I expect from myself in bootcamp
    </p>
    <p>
        I expect calmness and peacefulness through the course of each challenge. kind learning
        with myself and to become close to my cohort. I would like this to be a memorable experience
        in which I can say I truly developed and enjoyed myself.
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        What I expect of the team in bootcamp
    </p>
    <p>
        A friendly group which will encourage, motivate and support me through this journey of
        learning. A good enviroment is all that I would really be expecting. 
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        Out of EDA schedules 
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment I do not really have any scheduled activities for after bootcamp times
        I freed up most of my time so I can then mold myself around bootcamp. I would like to 
        start wrestling and something else on the side but I will see how that can fit in my
        time table once I start bootcamp.
