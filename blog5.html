        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </h3>
    <ol>
       <li>
        That I tend to push myself down when I do not understand something straight always.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
        That I get fixated on work and can sometimes get lost in it. This would happen on various
        different challenges.
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>
        My ego is quite fragile. Because its quite prominent, im aware of this and am working on it. So 
        again when I try something and its not the BEST I give myself a hard time.
       </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="coral">
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </h4>
    <p>
       To keep one calm and composed and to be kind to one self. If not you are not gonna get anywhere,
       they allow one to overcome problems and attain solutions with a clear mind.
    </p>
    <h5 class="coral">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h5>
    <p>
        That its so largely focused on this course, as in every single sprint. I think its cool.
    </p>
    <h6 class="coral">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h6>
    <p>
        definitely was talking about myself all the time. I am not the biggest fan of sharing too much 
        personal stuff about myself. This is not a problem though as I believe one should feel comfortable 
        doing so.
    </p>
    <h6 class="coral">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in 
        a web development bootcamp course?
    </h6>
    <p>
        Because human interaction and communication is hugely important for companies and for oneself. I studied
        business in England and the core development of employees improved vastly their overall performance.
        It makes for a better workforce and working enviroment. Can also give you more oppotunities as an individual 
        looking for work. 
    </p>
    <h6 class="coral">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time 
        to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h6>
    <p>
        To be honest I am not the BIGGEST fan of it. I think its very valuable for some people but for many others it can be
        a bit tedious going over stuff one is already aware of. I am a fairly sociable individua and have worked in many different 
        roles very well with my co-workers. I understand and respect myself (even thought the core helped me with this). I think 
        it was needed but not with that amount of it, I feel like I would have liked to spend a bit of that extra time coding. Regardless
        of my opinion I think its great to have that added core. It acts as a good momment to switch the braing to a different type of thinking.
        I changed opinion I think its a good implement. :)
