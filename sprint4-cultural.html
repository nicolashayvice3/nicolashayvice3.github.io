    <h4>
        NEUROPLASTICITY
    </h4>
    <p class = "coral">
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
    </p>
    <p>
        The fundametal understanding of neuroplasticity is great as it allows one to 
        understand/comprehend how their brain works in regards to learning. Being able to 
        understand it means that it will work even better, as it allows one to be aware of such process taking place. Knowing how something functions enforces it in the brain.
    </p>
    <p class = "coral">
        Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
    </p>
    <p>
        I already follow neuroplasticity for a while, I believe in it greatly. For me one of my favourite quotes is “the eternal student is the true master” it has a great meaning 
        when applying it to neuroplasticity. The mind is an enternal student and will constatly soak new information and skills, like a sponge.
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
    </p>
    <p>
        Practice new things is the greatest way. Learn, constantly learn be a student of life. Be curious learn new languages, knowledge, sports, literally anything. Have the curiosity 
        of a child and you will soak knowledge like one. 
    </p>
    <h5>
        GROWTH MINDSET
    </h5>
    <p class="coral">
        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
    </p>
    <p>
       The mindset of always being able to impove upon one self. If you were to compare to something it would be like being in video game and constantly being able to level up your 
       character, that is growth mindset. The relevance of it is that one will always bee improving and looking for new challenges with such mindset.
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
    </p>
    <p>
        Not really I have already been very fond of this and done a lot of research on my own accord. Will always be a fan of growth mindset and a follower of such. 
    </p>
    <p class="coral">
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
    </p>
    <p>
        I always do, im always improving. Hahahaha if I didnt I would still be crawling around crying for my mama. 
        But through this course it has enforced in me the ability to not stress out with challenge and consider them just part of growth mindset. I always have but this has SERIOUSLY enforced it.
    </p>
    <h6>
        reflections
    </h6>
    <p>
        Again these understandings are not new so not much will change in my overall mindset. But as always I will be an eternal student, always 
        learning and improving myself. The day I stop learning is the day I fall sleep and dont wake up. So my learning plan is to never stop learning!! I truly believe this is the correct mindset 
        one has to have if that want to learn in this life.

        Getting blocked on a simple problem
    </P>
    <p>
        So Apparently I was supposed to have one story for this, but lucky me! ive got dozens. The One that most stands out
        is a problem early on in the sprint weeks were I misused a , for a ; it stands out becuase I was literally over an 1h 
        on this and when I finally decide to ask for help, Naeri just points it out. Since then Ive made it a regular event to ask for 
        support when needed. 
    </p>
    <P class="coral">
        Solving a problem in an elegant way
    </P>
    <p>
        So as a person im not what you call elegant, but a moment that felt elegant for me was completing all of the fizzbuzz challenge.
        I had never really felt that kind of satisfaction and understating from my code. It made me feel proud...sadly it didnt last long 
        as built-in methods was around the corner.
    </p>
    <P class="coral">
        Problem solving techniques:
        The ones that I most used was googling, trying something, asking peers for help and reflecting. I mainly got fixated on these and used them
        the most as they were allowing me to accomplish my tasks. But I would love to start to use console.logging and pseudocode. I consider them both 
        to be super useful and I did use them, but in a very very small amount. 
    </P>
    <p>
        Most useful techniques order (by my personal opinion)
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li class="coral">trying something</li>
        <li>asking peers for help</li>
        <li class="coral">googling</li>
        <li>pseudocode</li>
        <li class="coral">console.logging</li>
        <li>reflecting</li>
