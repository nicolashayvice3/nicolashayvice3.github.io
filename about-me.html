        My life till now
    </h3>
    <p> 
       I would say that I lived a nomadic lifestyle for the great majority of my childhood. From constantly
       changing continents, countries, cities and towns. It has allowed me to experience a small part of this vast
       world, which has truly captivated me, since the start of this journey. I was born in New Zealand, Auckland
       but before I knew it my mums took me on a crazy adventure of backpacking through the world. I meet many people
       and learned to call home various places. Mainly I was moulded by Spain, England and New Zealand; being primarly
       the countries were I resided the most.

    <h4>
        Who I am or believe to be
    </h4>
    <p>
       I have always been a thinker, if thats a positive or a negative, well... im still thinking about it. I was taught
       to ask questions since a very young age (thank you Mama) which has lead me to question pretty much everything. I 
       enjoy understading how things work and people. The idea of knoweldge fascinates me tremendously and I truly beleive
       I am going to an eternal student in this life.
