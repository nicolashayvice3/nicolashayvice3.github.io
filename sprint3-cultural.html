        An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
    </p>
    <p>
       So HTML is the actual skeleton structure of the body, giving a frame to the body. While CSS is
       styling of the body such as, flesh, hair, freckles, etc. One allows for a structure to be used 
       and the other uses such structure and styles it.

       Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life
    </p>
    <p>
       Control flow is the flow of how the code executes and loops are a form of flow that gets repeated 
       for whatever amount of times specefied. Like going to sleep and flossing your teeth, its a process you 
       repeat every day (loop) and it is executed in a certain order, floss teeth then go to sleep.

       Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it
    </p>
    <p>
        The hierarchical structure of the web browser creates to make sense of everything is the dom. The 
        strcuture is based of the collision of html, css and javascript.

        The dom apart from the former elements it has more things beyond the base html, css and javascript.  
        Evrything that makes up the dom is usually most known as nodes.
        
        The nodes are everything from elements to atribbutes, comments, documented-related stuff and many more. 
        However all the underlaning nodes are not important as a web developer you wont be dealing with most of them. 
        
        html element - in the dome your html element start with a chain of node-element-htmlelement. Thats how 
        you acces the html element through the dom.
        
        the window object - The actual window of your borwser that contains all the information contained within
        it. you can do many things through your window page such as accesing the url, frames, using local storage, 
        information on screen and much more.

       Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </p>
    <p>
       Objects represent a group of things that can have different or certain characteristics while an array has set list 
       of data in a single variable. To access an array you use metric system starting from 0 using the square brackets, while
       with an object you specify directly which property you want, for example car or pen.

       Explain what functions are and why they are useful
    </p>
    <p>
       A function is a set of commands in which an input has been added and a output will be returned after a certain 
       procedure has taken place. These statements or procedures that take place provide the output after the input can be very versatile
       and allow for many changes to be performed.
